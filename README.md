# web-main

My main website. Code quality is questionable at most. Entering at your own risk. Oh, and if you wanna run it locally (for some reason), you need to create a `.env` file with a `PORT` variable.

# TODO

- [x] Scale to fit viewport
- [ ] Optimize it (based on [PageSpeed Insights raport](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-kapiwilq-dev/p0jbbmuz8h?form_factor=mobile))
